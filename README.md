# Creating an OpenAPI Specificaiton for an XML-RPC API

The OpenAPI Spec (previously called Swagger) is the new hotness
when it comes to documenting RESTful APIs. 
It should also support other network API protoocols
as well, including XML-RPC.

But there are limited details, and no examples, on the internet.
This repo is attempt to create an OpenAPI spec example
for a toy XML-RPC API so that we have a template for real work.

#TODO -- add more details and links

Support for OpenAPI 3 and above only
